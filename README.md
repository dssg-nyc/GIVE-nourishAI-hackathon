# GIVE-nourishAI-hackathon

Here’s a detailed checklist for your nonprofit hackathon focused on building a chatbot (ChatGPT + WhatsApp integration). I’ve organized it into **Pre-Hackathon Preparations** and **Day-of Hackathon Execution**, broken down into categories you’ll need to think about.  

***

## Pre-Hackathon Preparations

### Technical Prerequisites
- Sign up for and test **ChatGPT API key** access (OpenAI account setup, billing enabled, quota tested).  
- Ensure **WhatsApp Business API** (via Meta or Twilio/other providers) is set up, tested, and accessible.  
- Secure **any additional APIs** (Google Cloud, speech-to-text, translation, data enrichment, etc.) that teams may use.  
- Prepare **sample boilerplate code**, starter repositories, and documentation (Python/Node.js libraries for OpenAI, Twilio WhatsApp SDK examples).  
- Create a **GitHub repo or shared workspace** for participants to access starter kits.  
- Test all integrations before hackathon (small demo chatbot working with ChatGPT and WhatsApp).  

### Venue and Logistics
- Confirm venue booking (size large enough for teams, strong Wi-Fi, power supply, breakout areas).  
- Test **internet bandwidth** and ensure guest Wi-Fi credentials.  
- Arrange **tables, seating, and power strips** (at least 1 outlet per participant).  
- Order **A/V equipment**, microphones, projectors, and screens.  
- Prepare **check-in desk** setup: tables, lanyards/badges, pens, markers.  
- Print **signage** for directions (restrooms, food area, hackathon space).  

### Food & Beverages
- Order **meal catering** (breakfast, lunch, dinner if longer event, snacks).  
- Arrange **coffee/tea station** and water refill stations.  
- Consider **dietary needs** (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, halal/kosher options).  

### Sponsorship & Budget
- Finalize **sponsors** (API credits, prizes, food, venue).  
- Prepare **budget breakdown**: venue, food, swag, printing, prizes.  
- Order **prizes** (gift cards, tech gadgets, mentorship sessions).  

### Volunteers & Staff
- Recruit **volunteers** for registration, logistics, and team support.  
- Assign **mentors/tech helpers** for OpenAI API, WhatsApp integrations.  
- Designate **judges** (partners, sponsors, technical experts).  
- Train volunteers on **registration flow** and **timekeeping process**.  

### Marketing & Communication
- Launch **event website or registration portal**.  
- Confirm participant registrations and waitlist.  
- Send **pre-event email** with details: schedule, APIs, rules, starter kit links.  
- Create a **Slack/Discord server** for participant communication.  

### Judging & Deliverables
- Define **judging criteria** (e.g. Innovation, Functionality, Impact, Technical Implementation, Presentation).  
- Create a **submission form** (Devpost, Google Forms, or GitHub submission guidelines).  
- Prepare **presentation schedule** for final demos.
